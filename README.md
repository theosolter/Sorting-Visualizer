# Sorting-Visualizer

This is a Sorting Algorithms Visualizer built using Django and MatPLotLib (with MatPlotLib animations). The availale algortihms for visualization are Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort. The sorting visualizer portrays when a certain value in the array is being accessed by changing its color to red. This web application generates an MP4 video of the sorting algorithm chosen by the user sorting an array (represented by a graph) with length also chosen by the user. It does that by saving the MatPlotLib animation to an HTML video tag.


Instructions on how to use it are on the web app home page.


The web app was designed with video generation because I saw this as an opportunity to learn Python libraries and frameworks (such as Django and MatPLotLib), as well as how a web app works behind the scenes with requests from the server to display for users (using JavaScript, Ajax, HTML, CSS).
Also, this web app can be used by visual learners who would like not only to visually see the sorting algorithms working, but would also want the chance to go back, forth and pause the process to fully understand the algorithms.

I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed building it! - You can access it here (use Google Chrome!): http://theosolter.pythonanywhere.com/
